//! The RFQ lifecycle service: `RequestQuote` → `Quote`, `AcceptQuote` →
//! `Execution`, `RejectQuote` → `RejectAck`.
//!
//! This is the request-for-quote half of the trader workflow. A client sends a
//! [`celnet_proto::QuoteRequest`] carrying an [`celnet_proto::Instrument`], a
//! [`celnet_proto::Conventions`], and a client-supplied **idempotency key**; the
//! service:
//!
//! 1. prices the instrument through [`crate::pricer`] against the instrument's
//!    market context (carried in the request via the edge's published market
//!    state — see below), producing a mid and the full Greek set;
//! 2. turns the mid into a tradable two-way bid/offer via the [`crate::spread`]
//!    model;
//! 3. assigns a stable, **unguessable** `quote_id` (a fresh monotonic counter
//!    folded through a per-process-keyed `splitmix64` bijection — unique but not
//!    enumerable), stamps a publication time and a `valid_until` last-look
//!    deadline, and stores the quote keyed by both `quote_id` and the client
//!    idempotency key.
//!
//! # Idempotency
//!
//! The idempotency key makes a retried request safe: a second `RequestQuote`
//! carrying a key already seen returns the **same** stored [`celnet_proto::Quote`]
//! (same `quote_id`, same prices), never re-pricing and never issuing a new id. A
//! retried `AcceptQuote` on an already-booked quote returns the **same**
//! [`celnet_proto::Execution`], so a network retry can never double-book.
//!
//! # Trust model (request-matched accept / unguessable id)
//!
//! `quote_id` is **not** an authority token. `AcceptQuote` is request-matched to
//! the originating idempotency key: an accept whose `idempotency_key` does not
//! equal the key the quote was minted under is refused with `invalid_argument`, so
//! a party that merely learns a `quote_id` cannot accept (or hijack the booking
//! of) another requester's live quote. An accept-retry returns the stored
//! execution only when both the key **and** the traded side match; a side flip is
//! a different intent and is refused with `failed_precondition`.
//!
//! `RejectQuote` carries no key on the wire (the contract has only `quote_id` +
//! free-text `reason`), so it cannot be request-matched the same way. Instead,
//! every `quote_id` is **unguessable** — minted by folding a strictly-fresh
//! monotonic counter through a `splitmix64` bijection keyed by a per-process
//! secret — so the id space is sparse and unenumerable: only a party that received
//! the quote (and thus holds its id) can decline it. A re-reject is idempotent.
//!
//! # Market context
//!
//! An RFQ does not carry a `MarketContext` on the wire (the request is a trader
//! intent, not a market snapshot); the maker prices it against its own live
//! market. The service reads the engine's live [`celnet_engine::MarketState`]
//! through the [`CoreLink`] and projects it into the
//! [`celnet_proto::MarketContext`] the pricer consumes, so a quote always reflects
//! the maker's current market.
